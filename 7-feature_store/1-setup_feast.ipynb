    "## 🧮 Features Fun with Feast\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, models rely on well-defined **features**—structured data points that help predict outcomes. But managing these features across different projects and environments can quickly become complex. How do you ensure consistency between training and inference? How do you version and share features across teams?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where a **Feature Store** comes in. A Feature Store acts as a **centralized repository** for storing, processing, and serving machine learning features. It ensures that features are consistent, reusable, and efficiently retrieved for both training and real-time inference.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Feast (Feature Store)** is an open-source framework that simplifies feature management. It provides a **scalable and structured way** to store, retrieve, and serve features for machine learning models. By using Feast, organizations can:\n",
    "1. **Manage** feature definitions and metadata.\n",
    "2. **Store** features in offline and online databases.\n",
